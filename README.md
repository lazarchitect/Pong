# Pong
close recreation of the classic game in python's Pygame. AI is a bit dumb. Press q to quit.

I made this in a few hours, just to see how fast it would take me, so it's pretty barebones.

Possible options for the future:
-smarter AI paddle
-2 player
-score text changes color as it rises
-variable angles for the ball
-moving the paddle can give the ball some "spin" and make it travel faster or alter its course

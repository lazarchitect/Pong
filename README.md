# Pong
close recreation of the classic game in python's Pygame. AI is a bit dumb. Press q to quit.

I made this in a few hours, just to see how fast it would take me, so it's pretty barebones.

Possible options for the future:
  
  -smarter AI paddle
  
  -2 player
  
  -score text changes color as it rises
  
  -variable angles for the ball
  
  -moving the paddle can give the ball some "spin" and make it travel faster or alter its course
  
  -SFX for the ball hitting stuff or points being gained, or background music in general.
  
  -leaderboard?
  
  -ball hitting the side of the paddle bounces it up or down as it goes out (easy but useless)
  
  -paddle could have corner panels that make the ball faster when struck?
